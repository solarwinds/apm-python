           of the trace.
        2. Headers in the original request are not altered by the SW propagator.
        3. Some traceparent and tracestate are injected into service's outgoing request
           (done by OTel TraceContextTextMapPropagator).
        4. Sampling-related attributes are set for the root/service entry span.
